The codes in this package are supposed to be compiled and run on a Unix-Like system with gcc (to install gcc, see http://gcc.gnu.org) since we have used pthread to speed up the algorithm. To compute a kernel following the Introduction of our paper "Towards a Mathematical Foundation of Immunology and Amino Acid Chains" using this package, one should type

$make

to compile the dynamic libraries and then load the source file "computingKernel.R" in R environment (to install R, see http://www.r-project.org)

>source("computingKernel.R")

or you may simply do a test first by typing in R

>source("test.R")

and then two kernels, both normalized and unnormalized will be computed on a small set of peptides. Note that if the input chains contain some amino acid other than "A, R, N, D, C, Q, E, G, H, I, L, K, M, F, P, S, T, W, Y, V", the behavior of the program is unpredictable.

The package is also available at github: https://github.com/guoxin/computingKernel.git which will include any further improvements.
